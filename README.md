### Web application developed with Java and HTML5 from SpringBoots


This is a web application developed incrementally for the ICESI University Internet Computing course. In the docs folder are the statements for clarity of the problem. Certain Integration tests are performed for data cases. As well as SQL queries through DAO classes.

For security cases, the registration of a user is required. There are two types of users **ADMIN** and **OPERATOR**. Each one has specific functions and limited access to each window of the app.

## Tools used:
- SpringToolsSuite4 (sts)
- Lombok
- Html5
- PgAdmin
- SQL

## Security restrictions like
- Login
- Limited access according to the user

| ITEMS \ USERS        |  OPERATOR | ADMIN  |

| USERNAME | Stiven          | admin  |
| PASSWORD | admin         | admin  |
